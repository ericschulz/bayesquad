    <p>We would like to invite you to participate in this research project. You should only participate if you want to; choosing not to take part will not disadvantage you in any way. Before you decide whether you want to take part, it is important for you to read the following information carefully and discuss it with others if you wish. Ask us if there is anything that is not clear or you would like more information.</p>
   <p>We are investigating how people make sense out of their environment. In this study you will perform a simple computer task in which you need to learn about probability distributions. You will have to choose input values in order to observe the corresponding frequency distribution. After this, you will be asked to assess your own position on that given distribution. </p>
    <p>The study should not take longer than 10 minutes. Upon completion of the study, you will be paid a basic fee of Â£1. In order to qualify for the credit and bonus you need to finish the study.</p>
    <p>All data will be handled according to the Data Protection Act 1998. All responses are treated as confidential and anonymous. All data will be pooled and published in aggregate form only. Only Eric Schulz and researchers working with him will have access to these data. </p>
    <p>It is up to you to decide whether or not to take part. If you choose not to participate it will involve no penalty or loss of benefits to which you are otherwise entitled. If you decide to take part you are still free to withdraw at any time and without giving a reason.</p>

    <h3>Instructions:</h3>
<p><b>Please read the following instructions very carefully: </b></p>
<br>
<p> In the following study, it is your task to learn about a frequency distribution as well as you can. Learning about a frequency distribution means that you can observe how many people fell into different categories when we asked 10.000 people to provide us with their measurements. For example, if we had asked 1000 people about their weekly alcohol consumption, maybe 100 would have said to consume more than 40 units. </p>
<p> Your task now will be the following: </p> 
<p>1. Provide us with a self-assessment? For example, state how tall you are.</p>
<p>2. Estimate how many people will fall below your value. For example, estimate how many people (out of 1000) you think would be smaller than you.</p>
<p>3. Explore a frequency chart. Here, you will have the chance to explore a frequency distribution. Imagine that we have measured the body size of 1000 people. Now you can check, for example, how many of them were between 5'8 foot and 6 foot, etc. However, you only have 5 queries available. This means you can only look up how many people fell in between a certain range for five different ranges. It is your task to look up these frequencies as wisely as possible in order to assess where on the distribution you would be.</p> 
<p>4. Re-assess your original assessment. This time gives you the opportunity to reassess your original assessment based on the knowledge you have gained while exploring the frequency graph.</p>
