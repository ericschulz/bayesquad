    <p>We would like to invite you to participate in this research project. You should only participate if you want to; choosing not to take part will not disadvantage you in any way. Before you decide whether you want to take part, it is important for you to read the following information.</p>
   <p>We are investigating how people make sense out of their environment. In this study you will perform a simple computer task in which you need to learn about probability distributions. You will have to choose input values in order to observe the corresponding frequency distribution. Prior to and after this, you will be asked to assess your own position on a given distribution. </p>
    <p>The study should not take longer than 10 minutes. Upon completion of the study, you will be paid a basic fee of Â£1.</p>
    <p>All data will be handled according to the Data Protection Act 1998. All responses are treated as confidential and anonymous. All data will be pooled and published in aggregate form only. Only Christoph Niemeyer and researchers working with him will have access to these data. </p>

    <h3>Instructions:</h3>
<p><b>Please read the following instructions very carefully: </b></p>
<br>
<p> In the following study, it is your task to learn about a frequency distribution as well as you can. Learning about a frequency distribution means that you can observe how many people fell into different categories when we asked 1000 people to provide us with their measurements. For example, if we had asked 1000 people about their weekly alcohol consumption, maybe 100 would have said to consume more than 40 units. </p>
<p> Your task will be the following: </p> 
<p>1. Provide us with a self-assessment. For example, state how much you drink per week.</p>
<p>2. Estimate how many people will fall below your value. For example, estimate how many people (out of 1000) you think drink less than you.</p>
<p>3. Explore a frequency chart. Here, you will have the chance to explore a frequency distribution. Imagine that we have asked 1000 people about their drinking habits. Now you can check, for example, how many of them drank between 5 and 7 units or between 3 and 5 units, etc. However, you only have 5 queries available. This means you can only look up how many people fell in between a certain range for five different ranges. It is your task to look up these frequencies as wisely as possible in order to assess where on the distribution you would be later on.</p> 
<p>4. Re-assess your original assessment. This time gives you the opportunity to reassess your original assessment based on the knowledge you have gained while exploring the frequency graph. For example, once you have gotten an intuition about how many people fell within which range, it should be easier for you to assess your own habits, i.e. how many people drink less than you.</p>

         <p><b>I.</b> Below you see an empty plot of a frequency distribution. A frequency distribution tells you how many people of the 1000 people we have asked fell into different ranges (ranges are provided below). For example, how many of them are taller than 190cm.</p>
         <p><b>II.</b> You can use the slider to investigate different ranges. Ranges here are marked by their midpoints. If you slide around you will see different midpoints appear out of which you can choose one.</p>

         <p><b>IV.</b> You have a total number of 5 investigations available. As there are 10 possible bars to be shown, it is your task to choose the investigations wisely. No repetitions of chosen ranges is possible.</p>
         <p><b>V.</b> After you have seen 5 bars, your task will be to re-assess how many people you think were smaller than you. If you have chosen your investigations wisely, then your assessment should be more accurate.</p>
